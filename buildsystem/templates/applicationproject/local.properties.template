# local.properties file gets placed at project root
# properties that have default blank values as
# build switches are labeled
# only system env type stuff goes here
# for example proguard.cfg file location is
# is defined in build.properties because its not
# a system env based property whereas the
# password and name of key to sign product with
# is system env based and thus those properties
# are set, here, in the local.properties file
#
# build switches are left default blank or set here
# as it varies on dev setup and hence is system env
# derived

# Unix uses /dirName/ syntaxes whereas
# windows uses drivename:\dirName syntaxes
# sdk dir location absolute path
# android.platform.tools and the android.tools properties
# in parent project are computed/assigned from the sdk.dir
# property
sdk.dir=C:/Google/Android/android-sdk
# ndk.dir
# this is the only build switch defined in local.properties as
# its based on a system env location, default is empty hence
# if property not defined build assumes that we do not execute
# a ndk build
ndk.dir=
# graphviz executable path location
# several codeqa reports ant tasks use graphviz dot features
